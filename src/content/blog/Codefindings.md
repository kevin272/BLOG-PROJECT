# CODEFINDINGS
- just add a and b
- **ar.size()** gives the size of the array ar
- Vectors act as arrays. we can return vectors as **return{a,b}**
- Place data types properly eg: for float division you cannot use integer variables ie. it truncates the result to 0 or integer
- use long long for phone numbers or long int
